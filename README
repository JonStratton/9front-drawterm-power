FORK DESCRIPTION 
----------------
Fork of 9front's drawterm to try to get it to build on PowerMacs
running OS X 10.4

http://git.9front.org/plan9front/drawterm/HEAD/info.html

Currently, only OS X X11 version works (ie not Cocoa). So you
need X11 to run.

ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION
--------------------
This is a fork of Russ Cox's drawterm to incorporate features
from Plan9front (http://9front.org), most importantly DP9IK
authentication support (see authsrv(6)) and the TLS based rcpu(1)
protocol.


INSTALLATION
--------------
To build on Mac OS X with X11 (xquartz), run CONF=osx-x11 make.
